Lexical : 
=========
1. Given statement is broken into small ,small segments ,in such way that no segment can be 
   re-divided ,such as segment is called lexical

2. Every lexical may or maynot have meaning associated with it.

3. Lexical is also called as character in programming 

 Example :
  Statement : Hai Ravi

	      H|a|i| | R|a|v|i

	     Lexical : H ,a, i ,R,a,v,i

 Statement  :Integer aval=bval+10;

	     I|n|t|e|g|e|r| |a|v|a|l|=|b|v|a|l|+|1|0|;

	    Lexical : I,n,t,e,g,e,r,a,v,a,l,=,b,v,a,l,+,1,0,;
	  
Token : 
======
1. Given statement is broken into small segments ,in such way that every segment
   has meaning associated with it,

2. Every segment is called Token.

3. Tokens are classified into five types :

	 1. Identifiers 
	 2. Keywords 
	 3. Constants 
	 4. Operators 
	 5. Separators 

Example :
	Statement : Hai Ravi 

	Tokens	   :Hai| | Ravi|

	Statement :Integer aval=bval+10;

		  : Integer| aval|=|bval|+|10|;

	
	Token		Type
	---------------------------
	Integer 	Keyword
	
	aval		Identifier
	
	=		Operator

	bval		Identifier

	+		Operator

	10		Constant

	;		separator



Keywords : 
===========
1. These are the reserved words whoes meaning is pre-defined by the compiler .

2. Meaning of these words doesnt change irrespective of where we use.

3. All the keywords are defined as lower case.

	Example : 
	if ,else,for,class,interface,class,extends,implements, public ,private,global ,protected


Separators : 
=============
	[] ===> Array braces 

	() ===> Functional braces 

	{} ===> Scope braces

	:  ===> Colon

	;  ===> Semi-colon

	.  ===> Period
	
	,  ===> Comma


Constants : 
=============
1. Elements whose values doesnt change are called constants.

2. Constants are classified into three types 

	a. Numerical Constants 
	b. String constants
	c. Boolean constants

3. Numerical constants : 
     	a. Any value which is formed with digits 0-9 with or without decimal point
	   and with or with sign is called Numerical constant

	Example : 
		10000.000
		+90
		-12333
		10000.23344
		12345.888
		123ABC123 : //Error ===> String 


4. String constant : 
	a. It is collection of characters surrounded by single quotes .
	Example : 
	'Satish Myla'
	'100-1234'
	'CaptialInf00001'
	'ICICI00001'
	'040-12345'
	'(040)-12344'
	'+919000000'	
	  

5. Boolean constant : 
	a. It will specify true of false.
